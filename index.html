        <button class="accordion">Does Twist and Shout require a deposit?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">No, we do not require a deposit, we just ask that you look over your contract and make sure all the details are correct.</div>
        <button class="accordion">How many balloons can a twister create in an hour?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">This all depends on how elaborate you want us to go! Some of our more elaborate creations can take 4-6 minutes. Our simpler creations take about 2-3 minutes to create. Typically we can twist about 20-25 creations in an hour.</div>
        <button class="accordion">How many face painting and airbrush tattoos can you do in an hour?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">The same as balloons!</div>
        <button class="accordion">If I combine services, how many artists do I get?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">It Depends! If we have an artist available that can provide both services, then we send them out. But most of the time, two different artists will provide the different services.</div>
        <button class="accordion">Why is Body Airbrush Art becoming SO popular?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">Kids as well as adults have fallen in love with airbrush! It doesn’t smudge, you can have it at pool parties, and add a little glitter and jewels and what could be better!</div>
        <button class="accordion">How long do the body art airbrush tattoos stay on?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">Generally they stay on 3-5 days. But if you would like to remove them immediately, you can use rubbing alcohol.</div>
        <button class="accordion">Do you accept credit cards?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">Absolutely! We accept Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, and Discover. We also accept Pay Pal and Venmo.</div>
        <button class="accordion">Do I need to tip my artists?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">Tipping is absolutely not necessary, only appreciated.</div>
        <button class="accordion">What is the difference between airbrush body art and face painting?</button>
        <div class="panel py-10">The biggest difference between airbrush body art and face painting is the type of paint that we use. For body art, we use an alcohol-based paint that takes 3-5 days to come off (it does come off immediately with rubbing alcohol). For face painting, we use a water based paint that allows the paint to come off with water immediately.</div>
